# AI_USAGE.md
**Project:** Rebalancing_Project  
**Student:** Marius Fortuna  
**Course:** Advanced Programming (Fall 2025)

## Overview
I developed this project independently. I used AI tools as supplementary support (similar to documentation or forum troubleshooting) mainly to clarify library usage, diagnose bugs, and improve documentation. The research question, methodology design, implementation decisions, and interpretation of results are my own.

## AI tools used
- ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- Claude (Anthropic)

## How AI tools were used
1. **Library usage and references**
   - Quick clarifications on pandas time-series operations, scikit-learn evaluation patterns, yfinance data download usage, matplotlib plotting, and pathlib file paths.

2. **Debugging and sanity checks**
   - Help diagnosing runtime errors and edge cases (e.g., pandas alignment issues, time-series split constraints, imbalanced folds).

3. **Documentation**
   - Formatting and clarity edits for README and short explanatory text.

## What AI tools were not used for
- Defining the research question, experimental design, or overall approach.
- Choosing assets (IWM/TLT), weights, time period, or the train/test split logic.
- Writing the full codebase end-to-end.
- Writing results interpretations or conclusions (these are based on the outputs produced by my code).
